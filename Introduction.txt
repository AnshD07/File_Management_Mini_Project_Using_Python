Hello Everyone,

I’m excited to share a small project I created during my college days. It’s a Python script that helps organize the often cluttered Downloads folder on Windows.

Typically, everything in the Downloads folder is arranged by date, which can make finding specific files, like photos or videos, a bit challenging. My script, main.py, simplifies this by automatically sorting these files into designated folders.

I hope you find this tool helpful for managing your files more efficiently.

Thank you for checking it out!

Best regards, [Your Name]
