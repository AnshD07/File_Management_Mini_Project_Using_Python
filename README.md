## File Organizer - My First Python Project!

Tired of messy downloads?  This tool, built as my first Python mini project, sorts your files automatically!

**How it works:**

1. Run the main.py in your download folder (or any clutter folder).
2. Sit back and relax.  Images, documents, music, and more will be organized into separate folders.

**Features:**

* Automatic sorting - No more moving files by hand!
* Easy to use - Just run the python file!

**Get Organized!**

Follow the "Usage" section (coming soon) to start using the File Organizer.
